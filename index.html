If these trends continue, many privacy-friendly server providers on this page would likely have to shut down or require you to provide huge amounts of personal information. But it's not too late to stop it. Tell your government that this will kill your access to the world's fastest-growing industry <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339486326_Anti-money_laundering_The_world's_least_effective_policy_experiment_Together_we_can_fix_it">while imposing massive costs that bring almost no benefits</a>.

You can search by pressing Ctrl-F/Cmd-F, enabling case sensitive/"match case" in the dialog box, and searching in the page text for e.g RO to find all providers with locations in Romania. 2-letter country codes are listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes">here</a>.</p><p><b>Send updates or additions to: </b>updates at bitcoin-vps dot com</p><p>Make sure to include server and company locations. If they use BitPay please flag this. Additional notes (what level of anonymity is allowed at signup, whether they offer block storage / are suited to running Bitcoin full nodes, etc) are welcome.  Particularly interested in hosts that take Lightning payments and hosts in exotic locations.</p><p>Using BitPay or using providers that require it is strongly discouraged: many readers have complained BitPay requires a separate account and extensive personal information from the customer in order to pay for services from BitPay-using merchants.</p><p>We have a <a href="suggestions-for-providers.html">suggestions for hosting providers</a> page with recommended alternative payment providers, along with some other tips.</p><p>Privacy policy/Disclaimers: This website doesn't use cookies.
